# Beating heart

## @showdialog

In this project, you will make a beating heart animation on your micro:bit.

## 
You don't need ``||basic: on start||`` so let's drop it back into the toolbox (the middle section) to tidy it away.

## 
Now find the ``||basic: show icon||`` block.  It's in the Basic category in the toolbox.  

Put this inside the ``||basic: forever||`` block and then select the heart icon.

## 
Get another ``||basic: show icon||`` block (from the Basic category).  

Put this inside the ``||basic: forever||`` block and then select the small heart icon.

## 
Let's test your animation in the micro:bit on-screen simulator.

The micro:bit loops between a large and small heart to make the heart look like it is beating.  

## 
You can control the speed of your animation (fast or slow) by adding a pause block. 

Find the ``||basic: pause||`` block (in the Basic category).  Add it after the first ``||basic: show icon||`` block. 

## 
Add another ``||basic: pause||`` block (in the Basic category) and put it after the second ``||basic: show icon||`` block. 

Pauses are in milliseconds.  Change the numbers in the ``||basic: pause||``  blocks to change your animation speed. 

## 
Let's test your code again in the micro:bit on-screen simulator to see your changes.

You should see your new beating heart animation.  

## 
Now download your code onto your micro:bit.  Press the download button and follow the instructions.

You should see your beating heart animation on your micro:bit.
